# 👋 Welcome to Adi Testing!

## About Me
I'm a QA Engineer with a passion for breaking things (professionally, of course). This is where my love for testing meets my fascination with AI and automation. 
I'm building this little corner of GitHub to share my QA adventures and, hopefully, learn from yours too! Think of it as a playground where we can geek out about quality assurance together.

## Cool Stuff I'm Into 🌟

### Test Automation 🤖
- Automating repetitive tasks to save time and effort.

### Testing Methodology 🔍
- Mastering the art and science of breaking things efficiently.

### AI-Driven Testing 🧠
- Teaching robots to find bugs so we can enjoy more coffee ☕

### Edge Tech Testing 🚀
- **AI Systems**: Exploring the future of AI.
- **Blockchain**: Making sense of distributed ledgers.
- **Other Tech**: Delving into new tech that challenges the mind.
