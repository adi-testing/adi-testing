## About Me
I'm a QA Engineer with a passion for breaking things (professionally, of course). This is where my love for testing meets my fascination with AI and automation. 
I'm building this little corner of GitHub to share my QA adventures and, hopefully, learn from yours too! Think of it as a playground where we can geek out about quality assurance together.

## Cool Stuff I'm Into 🌟

- **Test Automation 🤖**: Automating repetitive tasks.
- **Testing Methodology 🔍**: Breaking things efficiently.
- **AI-Driven Testing 🧠**: Robots finding bugs for us ☕.
- **Edge Tech Testing 🚀**:
  - **AI Systems**: Exploring future AI.
  - **Blockchain**: Understanding distributed ledgers.
